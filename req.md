🎯 OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Refine the existing terminal hero so it communicates:

Clear role

Clear thinking

Clear value
with less abstraction and zero gimmicks.

Do not add new sections.
Do not redesign the site.
Only adjust content, hierarchy, spacing, and behavior.

🖥 TERMINAL CONTENT ADJUSTMENTS
1. Reduce terminal content length

Limit terminal output to 4–6 commands max

Remove any lines that are purely poetic or redundant

Each command must answer a recruiter question

2. Rewrite terminal copy for clarity

Replace abstract language with direct meaning, while keeping tone intelligent.

Target structure:

$ role
Frontend Systems Engineer

$ focus
Scalable React interfaces
Human-readable architecture
AI-augmented workflows

$ principles
Logic > Noise
Systems > Screens
Clarity > Cleverness

$ workflow
Human defines intent
AI accelerates execution
I ship maintainable systems

$ status
Open to building


If similar commands already exist, edit instead of adding.

🧠 TERMINAL BEHAVIOR ADJUSTMENTS

If typing animation exists:

Cap total animation duration to ≤ 1.5s

After load, terminal becomes static

Remove:

Infinite cursors

Repeating animations

Fake command errors

Terminal must feel like a snapshot of thought, not a performance

🎨 VISUAL TUNING (SUBTLE ONLY)

Reduce glow intensity by 20–30%

Increase line spacing slightly for readability

Ensure contrast favors reading comfort, not drama

If multiple accent colors exist → reduce to one

No new colors. No gradients added.

🧭 HIERARCHY FIXES

Emphasize:

Role

Focus

De-emphasize:

Philosophy blocks

Metaphorical language

If something competes visually with the terminal, lower its prominence.

🔗 CTA ADJUSTMENTS (IF PRESENT)

Ensure one primary CTA only

Secondary CTA must look secondary (text link, not button)

CTA copy must be concrete:

“View Selected Work”

“Read My Approach”

No motivational language.

❌ EXPLICITLY DO NOT

Add new terminal commands

Introduce hacker aesthetics

Turn the terminal into a playground

Add buzzwords or metrics in hero

Add skill lists here

✅ SUCCESS CHECK

After adjustment, a recruiter should be able to answer instantly:

What does this person do?

How do they think?

Does this feel safe to inherit?

If any line does not help answer one of those — remove it.
